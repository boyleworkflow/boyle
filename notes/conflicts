1. Discard all digests which noone trusts and at least one distrusts.

2. Now one of three things happen:

	Zero:
		Do nothing.
	One:
		If we trust it, use it.
		Else, if we distrust it, discard.
		Else, 
			a) Noone distrusts it. Use it!
			b) Someone distrusts it and someone else trusts it. Conflict!
		Use it if noone distrusts it. Otherwise conflict.
	More than one:
		Use it if we trust one and distrust all others. Otherwise conflict.

I think the following is equivalent:

Initial possibilities:

		Others
		+	0	-	+/-
Me 	+	Y 	Y 	Y	Y
	0	Y 	Y 	N 	C
	-	N 	N 	N 	N


If there are any digests with mixed opinions which the current user does not explicitly think anything about, there is a conflict:

		Others
		+	0	-	+/-
Me 	+	Y 	Y 	Y	Y
	0	Y 	Y 	N 	
	-	N 	N 	N 	N


Remove all digests the current user distrusts:

		Others
		+	0	-	+/-
Me 	+	Y 	Y 	Y	Y
	0	Y 	Y 	N 	

Remove all digests which noone trusts and at least one distrusts

		Others
		+	0	-	+/-
Me 	+	Y 	Y 	Y	Y
	0	Y 	Y
